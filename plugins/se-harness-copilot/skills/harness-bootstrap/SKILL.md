description: Recommend and install the harness components matching this project's profile — methodology, stack plugins, MCP servers, observability — opt-in per item, recorded in the lockfile.

# /harness-bootstrap — Phase 3 generator

Turn the profile into an installed harness. **Composable, opt-in** (the ECC lesson: users
cherry-pick; never install everything). Read `--dry-run` from `$ARGUMENTS`: if present, produce
the recommendation manifest and stop before installing anything.

## Step 0 — Guard & workspace scope
`.harness/profile.yaml` in the current directory → normal per-repo run, continue at Step 1,
nothing below applies. Missing, but `workspace.yaml` or `repos.txt` is present instead → this
is a **workspace root**, not a repo to bootstrap directly:

1. Ask once (AskUserQuestion): run across **every** declared/listed unit that's already
   bootstrapped (has its own `.harness/profile.yaml`), **specific units** (name them), or let
   you **suggest** units — propose any unit with a profile but an empty `components:` in its
   `.harness/agentstack.lock` (never bootstrapped) or a `pending-manual` status worth
   re-checking, and confirm the proposed list before proceeding. Never default to "every unit"
   without asking.
2. Skip and report any listed unit that has no `.harness/profile.yaml` yet — point at
   `/harness-init` for it; never attempt to bootstrap an un-initialized unit.
3. For each chosen unit, in order: `cd` into it and run Steps 1-6 of this same command,
   directly — same "continue the flow yourself" approach as `/harness-init` Step 1b. Each
   unit's recommendation manifest is its own (stack-driven) — unlike `/harness-init`'s
   methodology/structural-memory choices, nothing here is shared across units, so there's no
   "ask once" shortcut; Step 2's selection still happens per unit.
4. Once every chosen unit is done, report one consolidated table across all of them — unit |
   installed | pending-manual | declined — in addition to each unit's own Step 6 report.

Neither `.harness/profile.yaml` nor a workspace manifest/inventory present → tell the user to
run `/harness-init` first and stop.

## Step 1 — Build the recommendation manifest
Read `.harness/profile.yaml` (guard: must exist — run `/harness-init` first) and
`../se-harness-copilot/registry/recommendations.json`. Map profile → components:

- `methodology` → its entry (plugin or CLI install) — `se-harness` ("se-harness (built-in)" to
  the user) has a `kind: native` registry entry, nothing to install; skip it silently, no
  manifest row
- each `stack.*` value → its `plugins` list (skip entries with empty lists; surface their
  `note` so the user knows why nothing is recommended)
- `cloud` → its plugins
- `always` + `testing.e2e` → recommended for every project
- `observability.choose_one` → ask which (or neither)
- `sources`: Jira/Confluence set → `atlassian`; GitHub remote detected → `github`;
  `org.conventions_url` on Figma-backed design orgs → `figma`
- `memory.structural` → first check `profile.yaml`'s `memory.structural_driver` (and
  `workspace.yaml`'s `shared.memory.structural_driver` if a workspace manifest exists) — if
  `/harness-init` Step 6 already recorded a non-null choice, skip the question entirely and
  add that one driver's install command straight to the manifest as `kind: cli`, labeled
  "chosen at init." Only if it's still `null`/unset, ask fresh: note the A7 bake-off; offer
  codebase-memory-mcp's installer, one of the two unrelated "CodeGraph" projects
  (codegraph-ai/CodeGraph or colbymchenry/codegraph — disambiguate by repo, not name), or
  Graphify (Graphify-Labs/graphify — CLI + `/graphify` skill, not MCP-first: `uv tool install
  graphifyy` then `graphify install --project`), or defer

Present as a table: **component | why (profile key that triggered it) | source | install method**.
Never recommend a name not present in the registry file — gaps are stated, not improvised.

## Step 2 — User selection
AskUserQuestion with multiSelect over the manifest (group: methodology / stack / cloud /
core / observability / memory). Default-recommend the `always` group; everything else neutral.

## Step 3 — Install (only selected items)
For each selected component, by `kind`:
- **plugin**: try the CLI first —
  `copilot plugin marketplace add <marketplace>` (third-party only) then
  `copilot plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>`. If the `copilot` CLI is unavailable in this
  environment, print the exact commands for the user to run interactively and mark the item
  `pending-manual` in the lockfile.
- **cli**: run the registry's `install` command verbatim (confirm with the user first — it
  executes third-party code). **Exception: the Graphify component.** Don't run its bare
  `uv tool install graphifyy` here — hand off to `/harness-mem-graphify` instead (confirm
  first, same as any third-party install). It owns the fuller gated sequence this step doesn't
  (Python/uv prerequisite checks, an org's private package index from
  `shared.package_index` if set, the first index build, and the lockfile record) — running
  the bare command here would both duplicate and undercut it. **Exception: the OpenSpec
  component.** Same reasoning — hand off to `/harness-methodology-openspec` instead of the bare
  `npm install -g` command; it owns the gated install-plus-`openspec init` sequence and the
  lockfile record, and it's what `/harness-goal` later expects to find already set up.
- **mcp**: render the needed entries from `templates/mcp.json.tmpl` into the project's
  `.mcp.json` (merge — never clobber existing servers; secrets stay `${VAR}` references
  to `.env.harness`).

## Step 4 — Wire the harness pieces
1. Confirm the se-harness **agents roster** is active (ships with this plugin — architect,
   story-writer, implementers, db-engineer, unit/integration testers, e2e planner/generator/
   healer, release-manager). Offer to copy any of them into `.github/agents/` **only if** the
   user wants project-specific tuning (copied agents override plugin versions and stop
   receiving updates — say so).
2. Project-specific quality gates beyond the built-ins (gate-check, org-validate): point the
   user at the `hookify` plugin for authoring extra rules as hooks.
3. **Graphify selected and installed this run**: offer to wire
   `tools/harness/graphify-update-hook.sh` as a postToolUse hook for this repo (e.g. in
   `.github/hooks/`). It only runs the cheap incremental `graphify update . --no-cluster`
   after a commit, in the background, and no-ops instantly for any repo that didn't choose
   Graphify — it's opt-in per repo, never bundled into the plugin's own global hooks.json.
   Mention plainly that it can't cover the workspace-level merge (a hook only sees the repo its
   session is in) — `/harness-mem-graphify`'s own "Keeping this fresh automatically" section
   covers that gap and what to do about it.
4. Re-render AGENTS.md blocks via
   `bash tools/harness/render-block.sh <target> <block-file>` so the generated
   block reflects what's now installed.

## Step 5 — Record in the lockfile
Update `.harness/agentstack.lock`: for every component — name, source, version (if known),
install method, status (`installed` / `pending-manual` / `declined`), date. Declined items are
recorded too, so `/harness-sync` doesn't re-nag about them.

## Step 6 — Report
Installed / pending-manual / declined table; exact manual commands for anything pending;
next step: `/harness-goal <your first goal>`.
